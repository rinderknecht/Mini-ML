(* The call [get_token ~log] evaluates in a lexer (a.k.a
   tokeniser or scanner) whose type is [Lexing.lexbuf -> Token.t].

     The argument [log] is a logger. As its type shows and suggests,
   it is a pair made of an output channel and a printer for
   tokens. The lexer would use any logger to print the recognised
   tokens to the given channel. If no logger is given to [get_token],
   no printing takes place while the lexer runs.

     The call [reset ~file ~line buffer] modifies in-place the lexing
   buffer [buffer] so the lexing engine records that the file
   associated with [buffer] is named [file], and the current line is
   [line]. This function is useful when lexing a file that has been
   previously preprocessed by the C preprocessor, in which case the
   argument [file] is the name of the file that was preprocessed,
   _not_ the preprocessed file (of which the user is not normally
   aware). By default, the [line] argument is [1].
